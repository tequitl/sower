# Sower - Decentralized Social Network Platform

## What is Sower?

Sower is a project that enables the creation of a decentralized social network by allowing users to maintain their own WordPress instances as personal profiles. The name "Sower" draws inspiration from the ancient Mesoamerican tradition of maize cultivation, where each kernel of corn represents a unique profile that grows independently yet remains connected through a network of roots and shared knowledge. Just as the Three Sisters (corn, beans, and squash) grow together in harmony, supporting and enriching each other, Sower creates a network where individual profiles thrive while contributing to a larger, interconnected community.

## Core Concept

The platform operates on the principle of decentralization, where:

1. Each user maintains their own WordPress instance
2. Content ownership remains with the creator
3. Users have full control over their data and presentation

## How It Works

### Personal Profiles
- Each user gets their own WordPress installation


### Network Integration
- WordPress instances communicate through APIs
- Content can be shared across instances
- Users can follow other profiles
- Activity streams are aggregated

## Benefits of Decentralization

1. **Data Ownership**
   - Users own their content
   - No central authority controls the network
   - Freedom to move or modify content

2. **Privacy**
   - Control over personal data
   - Customizable privacy settings
   - No central data collection

3. **Customization**
   - Unique profile designs
   - Custom functionality
   - Personal branding


## Technical Implementation

The platform uses:
- WordPress as the base CMS
- REST API for communication
- ActivityPub protocol for federation
- Custom plugins for network features

## Getting Started

1. Clone the Sower repository


## Future Development

- Enhanced federation features
- Improved content discovery
- Better privacy controls
- Advanced networking tools
